# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on developing a credit card fraud detection system utilizing machine learning methodologies, aimed at discerning fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. Following rigorous data preprocessing steps , we visualized the data to gain insights into its distribution and patterns. Subsequently, a Random forest Classifier is trained on the preprocessed data to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The model demonstrates exceptional performance, boasting an accuracy score of 99.99%, showcasing its ability to accurately classify transactions. Moreover, with precision and recall scores exceeding 99% and an F1-score of 99.99%, the model exhibits high efficacy in correctly identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives. This robust performance underscores the effectiveness of the developed system in mitigating credit card fraud risks and safeguarding financial transactions.
